lxqt-archiver (0.3.0-2ubuntu1) hirsute; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Build-depend with version on libfm-qt-dev (>= 0.16.0)
    (Requested by Lubuntu Team, to force proper qt dependency versions)
  * This upload fixes the FTBFS introduced by 0.3.0-2 caused by the version 
    of libfm-qt-dev not being 0.16.0 at the time of initial build after auto-
    sync.
  * This will block autosync as well in the future, permitting this package
    to be merged and not automatically superseded (as needed by the Lubuntu 
    Team for other libraries' compatibilities).
